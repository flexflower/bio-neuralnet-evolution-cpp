# Bio Neuralnel Evolution
An old project of mine implemented in C++.

Original project: [bio-neuralnel-evolution](https://github.com/flexflower/bio-neuralnet-evolution)

Check out [David R. Miller](https://github.com/davidrmiller) whose similar project [biosim4](https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4) greatly helped me during development.

## Compiling (Win)
Make sure you have MinGW or any other C++ compiler installed.
```
g++ src/temprule.cpp -o <out>.exe
```
